# bigram_model
It's an implementation of the Bigram model using a basic neural network to generate new names by analyzing the 'Names' text files which contain 32,000 names.
Also, a multilevel perceptron is created that goes one step ahead of the Bigram and takes in and analyzes 3 characters instead of 2 to make predictions.
All the code implementation is done in jupyter notebook.
